    <h4>“Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it”
    </h4>

    <p> In order to pursue our attempt to elucidate this question, the present topic is going to deal with another
        prominent figure in the modern history and thought; Karl Marx. More than 200 years after his birth, his legacy
        still retains all its power, and his influence is ever-present in all fields of humanities and social sciences;
        endlessly read, endlessly commented, and endlessly analyzed. (His biography is available on encyclopedia
        Britannica or https://www.marxists.org/francais/index.htm or other sources that you can consult).
    </p>

    <p>His key works are: <br> <br>
        -Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1818 <br> <br>
        -The German Ideology (1845) <br> <br>
        -Communist Manifesto (with Friedrich Engels, 1848) <br> <br>
        -Das Kapital (3 volumes, 1867, 1885, 1895) <br> <br>
    </p>

    <p>For Marx, the process of human history is not randomly occurring; it is rather regulated by the law of class
        struggle. He plainly argues that:</p>
    <p>“The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and
        plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant
        opposition to one another…The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has
        not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new
        forms of struggle in place of the old ones.” (Manifesto of the Communist Party, 1848)
    </p>

    <p>Marx’ idea is that the modern industrial capitalism, with its unrestricted liberal rights has fallen short of
        spreading happiness to all people stratum, hence it has led to the division of the society into two hostile
        classes, struggling with each other; Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.
    </p>
    <p>1- Bourgeoisie represents the class of the capitalists; owners of the means of production, they are the oppressor
        employers.
    </p>
    <p>2- Proletariat represents the class of the workers or the proletariat. They are the oppressed employee. As
        defined in The Principles of Communism (1847) by F. Engels, proletariat refers to
    </p>

    <p>Thus, capitalism has engendered a society of unequals.
    </p>

    <p>The cause of the division of the industrial capitalist society of Victorian era is due, according to Marx, to the
        priority given to freedom over equality. He is persuaded that political emancipation cannot be the privileged
        target in the social reconstruction or change. Furthermore, the requisite change can neither be accomplished by
        compromises and mere reformist procedures, nor utopian socialist cooperatives (suggested by R. Owen), instead of
        that; it urgently needs a revolutionary action. But, what justifies Marx’ determination to revolution as the
        only means to overthrow the whole capitalist system and found a just society?</p>

    <h4> Alienation</h4>
    <p> Under the maxim: “from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs”, socialism gives priority
        to the common property and the good of all the members of a society. Each person will be given equal amount of
        resources and goods (education and health care for instance), supervised by a centralized control of the state.
    </p>

    <p> Note here, that the state is still needed as an institution, which regulates the just distribution of wealth. In
        other words, within socialism, the state’ function is still essential. But when the proletariat reaches a
        highest level of proletarian consciousness; a level in which the good of everyone is the good of the whole
        society, the state becomes no more essential and its abolition is compulsory. Precisely at this point, the
        transition from socialism to communism occurs.</p>

    <h4>Drawbacks</h4>
    <p>Seemingly, Marx believes in the perfection of man, as he echoes Rousseau idea about the goodness of man and his
        love, compassion and unselfish benevolence. However, “it is unprecedented to demand of men who have lived
        hitherto in civil society, i.e. under institutions that have presupposed or positively cultivated self-interest
        as the principle of productive life and life itself to overlook to seek their own interests, pursue their
        ambitions and benefit from their advantages” (Strauss & Cropsey, 1987, p809). It seems that Marx’ idea about
        collectivism and living together is not compelling enough because man is an egoistic being, mostly driven by his
        instincts and interests than the high values of altruist morality.
    </p>

    <p> As a conclusion, it goes without saying that the influence of Marxism has stretched out into contemporary
        history, even in combatting COV19; there is a kind of claim to rethink Communism. In the 1990s the USSR was
        dissolved, socialism declined, and the revolution declared its failure. Paradoxically, China is still claiming
        to be a communist country!

    <h4>Questions</h4>
    <p>-What is the position of Marx towards liberalism? Does he refute liberalism as a doctrine of human rights? Or
        does he only refute its economic apparatus?</p>
    <p>-How does Marx conceive political emancipation?</p>
    <p>-How does Marx conceive the role of the state?</p>
    <p>-What is a just society according to Marx?</p>
